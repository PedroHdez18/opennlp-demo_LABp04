In
a
village
of
La
Mancha
the
name
of
which
I
have
no
desire
to
call
to
mind
there
lived
not
long
since
one
of
those
gentlemen
that
keep
a
lance
in
the
lance-rack
an
old
buckler
a
lean
hack
and
a
greyhound
for
coursing
Apache
Maven
is
a
powerful
build
automation
and
project
management
tool
primarily
used
in
Java-based
projects
It
simplifies
the
build
process
by
managing
dependencies
compiling
code
running
tests
and
packaging
the
application
among
other
tasks
Maven
uses
an
XML
file
known
as
the
POM
(Project
Object
Model)
to
define
the
project
structure
dependencies
and
build
configuration
